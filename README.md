# Crime Prediction and Prevention

## Overview
Crime Prediction and Prevention is a machine learning-based project designed to analyze past crime data and predict future crime trends. The system leverages data analytics, predictive modeling, and visualization techniques to enhance public safety by identifying high-risk areas and recommending preventive measures.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict potential crime occurrences based on historical data.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays crime-prone areas on a map for easy interpretation.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzes trends and patterns in crime data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive front-end for inputting data and viewing results.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Database**: CSV/SQL-based storage for crime data

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saurabhthakur023/Crime-prediction-and-prevention.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Crime-prediction-and-prevention
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage
- Enter crime-related details such as **year, case type, and state**.
- Click the **Predict** button to analyze and visualize crime trends.
- View crime hotspots on an interactive map.

## Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available crime datasets, processed and formatted for training the prediction model.
